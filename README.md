# Gill’s Primes
Jack told Gill “I have found three equally-spaced prime numbers, 29, 41, and 53. The difference between the first and second is the same as the difference between the second and third, and there are no repeated digits in the six digits of my primes.”

Gill told Jack she had also found three equally-spaced primes, each having three digits with no repeated digits in the nine digits of her primes. She said, “If I told you that the three-digit sum of each of my primes is an odd number then you should be able to find them.”

### In ascending order, what are Gill’s three primes?
The answer given by the newspaper was 157, 283, 409

## Haskell programming
I used Haskell language to write a code to print out the answer of Gill's primes. This program should print [([4,0,9],[2,8,3],[1,5,7]),([1,5,7],[2,8,3],[4,0,9])].
